# Bible in Markdown: An Ancient Perspective on Christ's Divinity

Welcome to the **Bible in Markdown** repository, where you can explore a unique representation of the Bible that seeks to remain faithful to the translations of early Christians regarding the divinity of Christ. This project is designed to provide a convenient way to read, study, and integrate the Bible into your favorite text editor, with a focus on compatibility with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

## Highlights

- **Ancient Christian Tradition:** Rooted in the perspectives of early Christians, this Markdown representation of the Bible strives to uphold and preserve verses about the divinity of Christ that are sometimes omitted in modern Catholic translations. The approach is more akin to the spirit of translations like the [Jerusalem Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem_Bible) or the [Reina Valera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reina-Valera), rather than the modern, diluted Catholic translations that may downplay Christ's divinity.

## Exploring the Bible

We invite you to explore this distinctive perspective on the Bible's portrayal of Christ's divinity within the Markdown framework. As you engage with the scriptures, you'll encounter passages that emphasize and uphold the profound nature of Christ's divinity, offering a richer understanding of the theological beliefs held by early Christians.

## Project Philosophy

This project is guided by the intention to remain loyal to the translations and interpretations of the earliest Christians, particularly in relation to the divinity of Christ. The focus is on presenting a robust and authentic representation of these elements, in contrast to certain modern Catholic translations that might diminish Christ's divinity.
