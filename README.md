# Biblia Markdown: A Traditional Catholic Perspective

Welcome to the **Biblia Markdown** repository, where you can explore the Catholic Bible in Markdown format. This project is designed to provide a convenient way to read, study, and integrate the Bible into your favorite text editor, with a focus on compatibility with Obsidian.

## Highlights

- **Catholic Tradition:** Rooted in the traditional Catholic faith, this Markdown representation of the Bible encompasses 73 books, each thoughtfully organized for easy navigation.
- **Traditional Approach:** While adhering to the Catholic canon, we've included verses regarding the divinity of Christ that are often omitted in modern Catholic Bibles, yet remain significant in many Protestant translations. This approach aims to provide a comprehensive perspective without aligning strictly with either tradition.

## Exploring the Bible

We invite you to explore the richness of the Catholic Bible and its theological nuances within this Markdown framework. As you journey through the scriptures, you'll find passages that offer insights into the divinity of Christ, fostering a deeper understanding of both Catholic and broader Christian perspectives.

## Project Philosophy

Please note that this project seeks to create a balanced representation of the Catholic perspective while acknowledging the inclusion of certain verses that might be more emphasized in Protestant traditions. The goal is to facilitate meaningful exploration and study of the Word, fostering cross-denominational understanding.
