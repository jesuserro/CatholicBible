# Prologue (Jn 1:1-18)

1 In the beginning was the Word,
  and the Word was with God,
  and the Word was God.

2 He was with God in the beginning.

3 All things were created through Him,
  and without Him nothing was created that has been created.

4 In Him was life,
  and that life was the light of men.

5 The light shines in the darkness,
  but the darkness has not understood it.

6 There came a man, sent from God, whose name was John.

7 He came as a witness to testify about the light,
  so that all might believe through him.

8 He was not the light,
  but he came to bear witness of the light.

9 The true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world.

10 He was in the world,
   and though the world was made through Him,
   the world did not recognize Him.

11 He came to His own,
   and His own did not receive Him.

12 Yet to all who did receive Him,
   to those who believed in His name,
   He gave the right to become children of God,

13 children born not of blood,
   nor of the will of the flesh,
   nor of the will of man,
   but born of God.

14 The Word became flesh
   and made His dwelling among us.
   We have seen His glory,
   the glory of the one and only Son from the Father,
   full of grace and truth.

15 John testified concerning Him and exclaimed,
   “This is He of whom I said,
   ‘He who comes after me has surpassed me,
   because He was before me.’”

16 From His fullness we have all received grace upon grace.

17 For the Law was given through Moses,
   but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.

18 No one has ever seen God,
   but the one and only Son, who is Himself God
   and is in closest relationship with the Father, has made Him known.
